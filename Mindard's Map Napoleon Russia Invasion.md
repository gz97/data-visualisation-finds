# Minard's Map: Napoleon's Russia Invasion
## *Figurative Map of the successive losses of men of the French army during the Russian campaign 1812â€“1813.*

- The style of the graphic is called 'flow map'. A flow map is a combination of maps and flow diagrams, where the width of the arrows is proportional to the flow rate. It is often used to portray animal migrations, money flow, the traffic of goods and people, etc. The arrows show direction, while the width illustrates the quantity. 
- The main difference between the flow map and Minard's map is the lack of arrows. While the shape of the red line indicates movement, we need to consult the description to understand its direction.
- Time dimension is missing - as readers we have a feeling of continuity and unstopabble force of the army. We can't tell that from the map that Napoleon stayed in Moskwa for a month, it seems as if the army went back stright away.

## Elements of the map
### 1. The map  
- The background of the graphic is a real map with names of places and drawn rivers.
- The big label 'Moscou' directs us to Russia and adjancent territories of Poland and Lithuania.
- A scale bar in the lower right of the map, indicating the map scale, completes the legend (the map measures distance based on the French
league, which equals approximately 4 kilometers)
